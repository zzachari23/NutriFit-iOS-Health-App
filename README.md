# NutriFit_iOS_Health_App

## About The Project

The project's overall purpose is to demonstrate my ability to master new programming languages, tools, and environments. The project is a health, fitness, and nutrition iOS app I built using Swfit, SwiftUI, and Xcode. At its core, the application serves as a digital nutrition companion. Users can effortlessly access information on diverse food categories and individual food items, accompanied by detailed nutritional insights. This feature equips users with the knowledge needed to make informed and health-conscious dietary choices. A standout feature of the app is its sophisticated calorie calculator, grounded in the 'Revised Harris-Benedict Equation.' It allows users to determine their ideal calorie intake for weight loss, maintenance, or gain, offering personalized guidance on their fitness journey. In addition to its nutritional prowess, the app serves as a fitness mentor. It provides valuable guidance on exercising various muscle groups, with dedicated pages for each exercise. These pages include instructional GIFs, YouTube video links, and step-by-step written instructions, ensuring users can access comprehensive fitness support. The user interface is thoughtfully designed, featuring intuitive buttons, captivating animations, and a seamless navigation experience. Many of the animations were manually hardcoded using SwiftUI's animation library. To further enrich the user experience, the app incorporates multimedia elements. Sound and video bites, sourced from URL links and integrated using the Swift AV AudioPlayer Class, are seamlessly woven into the app's loading menu, buttons, and navigation views. Behind the scenes, the app draws on up-to-date food nutrition data obtained from online databases through JSON APIs. This data is then meticulously parsed into a Swift-readable format, ensuring users can access the most current and accurate information. In summary, this iOS app demonstrates my dedication to mastering new technologies and my commitment to delivering a robust and user-friendly solution in the realms of health, fitness, and nutrition.
